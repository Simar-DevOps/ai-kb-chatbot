# VPN Troubleshooting
## Common Issues
- Wrong credentials
- MFA prompt not appearing
- Network blocks

## Fixes
1. Confirm username format: firstname.lastname
2. Reset password if recently changed (wait 5-10 minutes).
3. Re-enroll MFA if prompts do not appear.
4. Try a different network (hotspot) if corporate Wi-Fi blocks VPN.
5. If error says "certificate missing", reinstall VPN client.

## Escalation
Include: device type, OS version, timestamp, screenshot of error.
