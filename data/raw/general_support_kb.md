\# General Support KB (Internal)



\## Shared Drive Access (Shared Drive / Application)

\- If you need access to a shared drive, submit an \*\*Access Request\*\* ticket with:

&nbsp; - drive name/path

&nbsp; - business justification

&nbsp; - manager approval (if required)

\- If the shared drive application is not connecting:

&nbsp; - confirm you are on the corporate network/VPN

&nbsp; - retry after reconnecting

&nbsp; - if still failing, open a ticket with screenshots and timestamps



\## Internal Sites Access (Connects / Internal Sites)

\- If you cannot access internal sites:

&nbsp; - confirm VPN is connected

&nbsp; - confirm you are logged into SSO

&nbsp; - try a different browser / clear cache

&nbsp; - if the site is restricted, request access through the access request process



\## Ticket Triage: Classify + Route (Finance / Drive)

\- When a request comes in, classify the issue:

&nbsp; - Access/Permissions → route to IAM/Access team

&nbsp; - Billing/Invoices/Payments → route to \*\*Finance\*\*

&nbsp; - Outage/System error → route to \*\*Incident/On-call\*\*

\- If urgent, include severity/impact and escalate via the incident process



\## Public Cautions

\- Do not post internal links, credentials, or sensitive customer/org data in public channels.

\- If sharing is needed externally, redact sensitive fields and use approved channels.



\## How to Summarize Into Bullets (and Cite)

\- Prefer short bullet summaries:

&nbsp; - What happened

&nbsp; - What user expected

&nbsp; - What we observed

&nbsp; - Next steps / workaround

\- When answering using the KB, include citations like:

&nbsp; - “Do X first.” \[S1]

&nbsp; - “Then Y.” \[S2]
